Assignments and project files 

The assignment files focus on creating and manipulating sample frequencies via python librairies.

KeepUp is a MIR project based on Time-Scale Modification (TSM), allowing a user to alter the tempo of
an input audio sample. There is also a simple GUI to simplify the upload and modification process. 

All files were written in Python, using Anaconnda.
